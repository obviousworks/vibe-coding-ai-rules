The Ultimate Vibe Coding Guide for AI IDEs like Windsurf, Cursor etc. â€“ AI-optimized rules, best practices, and configuration files for efficient and controlled AI-powered coding.

## Level up your AI coding with Windsurf, Cursor or other AI IDEs! 

### ðŸš€ This repository contains:

- A complete Vibe Coding Ruleset for optimized AI coding workflows.
- A detailed global_rules.md configuration file, for global vibe-coding seetings.
- An example of a projec specific vibe-coding file: .windsurfrules
- A super AI / LLM prompt, which helps you to adapt the project-specific config file (.windsurfrules) to your needs and projects
- Best practices for clean, efficient, and controlled AI-driven development.

## Configuration Architecture
Windsurf employs a two-tier configuration approach:

- Global Rules (global_rules.md): Establish universal standards across all projects
- Project-Specific Rules (.windsurfrules): Define contextual requirements for individual projects

This separation creates a powerful inheritance model where project configurations extend global standards while adding domain-specific knowledge.


#### âš¡ Stay in control. Code smarter. Deploy faster.
