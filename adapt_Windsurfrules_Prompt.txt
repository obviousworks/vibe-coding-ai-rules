I need you to help me create a tailored .windsurfrules file for my project that follows the "Vibe-Coding" methodology for AI-assisted development in WindSurf IDE. I'll provide details about my project, and I want you to generate a comprehensive configuration file similar to the example below but customized for my specific needs.

Based on this information, please create a comprehensive .windsurfrules file that follows the Vibe-Coding methodology. The file should include:

A detailed project context section
A complete technology stack specification with versions
A well-structured directory tree
Specific coding conventions and style guidelines
Workflow protocols for AI-assisted development
Custom rules for AI interaction within this project
Performance and security considerations
Any project-specific patterns or architectural principles

Please format the output as a complete Markdown file that I can use directly as my .windsurfrules file in WindSurf. Include all sections from the example (Project Context, Technology Stack, Project Structure, etc.) but tailored to my specific project needs.
Use a structured approach with clear headings, bulleted lists, and code blocks where appropriate. Include both high-level guidelines and specific technical details to provide comprehensive guidance for the AI.
